This is my take on a simple [Chip8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator in Rust.

It's my first attempt at writing Rust, and should be regarded just as an hello world to emulators.

You need to install `sdl2` on your system:

macos: `brew install sdl2`

arch: `yay sdl2`

ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev`

To run, just `cargo install` and then `cargo run pong.rom`.
